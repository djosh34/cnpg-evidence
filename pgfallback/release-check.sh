# Fetches pgfallback at <query> through proxy.golang.org only, as an
# application does, builds a file that imports it, checks that go recorded
# <version>, and runs go mod verify. Retries the fetch for up to two minutes,
# the proxy's delay for a new version. The last job of release.yml runs it
# with the tag as both arguments.
#
# The first request for a version fixes it in the proxy and in
# sum.golang.org for good, and a request before the tag exists can keep the
# proxy answering "not found" for up to 30 minutes. So ask for a tag only
# once it is pushed. To try the script before a release, give a pushed
# commit of main and its pseudo-version, which asks the proxy for no tag.
#
# Needs go.
#
# Usage: bash pgfallback/release-check.sh <tag or commit> <version>
